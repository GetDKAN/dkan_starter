### DKAN Datastore

DKAN Datastore bundles a number of modules and configuration to allow users to upload CSV files, parse them and save them into the native database as flat tables, and query them through a public API.

DKAN Datastore is part of the DKAN distribution which makes it easy to create an Open Data Portal.

DKAN Datastore is part of the [DKAN](https://drupal.org/project/dkan "DKAN homepage") project which includes the [DKAN profile](https://drupal.org/project/dkan "DKAN homepage") which creates a standalone Open Data portal, and [DKAN Dataset](https://drupal.org/project/dkan_dataset "DKAN Datastore homepage").

DKAN Datastore is currently managed in code on Github but is mirrored on Drupal.org.
