# DKAN Starter

DKAN Starter is a fully-built website codebase for implementing the [DKAN](https://github.com/NuCivic/dkan) including build and deployment scripts and tools. It is comprised of the DKAN Drupal Distribution for open data management, plus several popular additional features, configurations that streamline the process of managing and supporting the code in a Drupal platform-as-a-service (PaaS) cloud hosting environment, and configurations that assist with typical government data and security standards compliance.

[Full documentation is available here](https://dkan-starter.readthedocs.io).

We are open to contributions to this NuCivic Data repo (especially to the documentation), but in general we encourage developers interested in contributing to Drupalâ€™s open data management capabilities to contribute to the DKAN distribution project instead, at http://github.org/NuCivic/dkan.
