NuData Starter is an open-source code repository on github that NuCivic uses as the basis for the NuData software-as-a-service is comprised of:

* the DKAN Drupal Distribution for open data management, plus
* several popular additional features, 
* additional curated demo content, 
* configurations that streamline the process of managing the code in a Drupal platform-as-a-service (PaaS) cloud hosting environment, and 
* configurations that assist with typical government data and security standards compliance

Free demos of NuData Starter can be requested by filling out the form at http://nucivic.com/products/nudata/demo/.

Because we use NuData Starter to manage our software-as-a-service, it is frequently updated and we do not guarantee backwards compatibility.   Therefore, if you wish to build a custom open data website based on Drupal, we recommend that you start with the code from the DKAN Drupal Distribution repository instead.

We are open to contributions to this NuData repo, but in general we encourage developers interested in contributing to Drupalâ€™s open data management capabilities to contribute to the DKAN Distribution project and repository instead.
