NuCivic Data Starter is an Open Data platform powered by the DKAN Drupal Distribution created by NuCivic. NuData takes DKAN further by adding additional features.

NuCivic Data Starter provides:

* a best-practices example of building sites and services off of DKAN
* additional features not provided by DKAN

Free demos of NuCivic Data Starter can be requested by filling out the form at http://nucivic.com/products/nudata/demo/.

[NuCivic Data Enterprise](http://www.nucivic.com/products/nudata/enterprise/) is a software-as-a-service offering based off of NuCivic Data Starter.

Because we use NuCivic Data Starter to manage our software-as-a-service, it is frequently updated and we do not guarantee backwards compatibility.   Therefore, if you wish to build a custom open data website based on Drupal, we recommend that you start with the code from the DKAN Drupal Distribution repository instead.

We are open to contributions to this NuCivic Data repo, but in general we encourage developers interested in contributing to Drupalâ€™s open data management capabilities to contribute to the DKAN Distribution project and repository instead.
