Data Config Module
------------------

The "Data Configuration" module contains setup and configuration items for DKAN Starter sites.

It contains a list of all modules that should be enabled.

Update functions that need to be run for updates that are not part of DKAN are included here.

It is called "Data" config because this project used to be named "Data Starter".
