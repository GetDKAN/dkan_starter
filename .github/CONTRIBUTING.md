### Changelog Guidelines

Pull Requests should included updates to CHANGELOG.md under **Next Release**. Keep it tidy. If you don't know how, please follow http://keepachangelog.com/ guidelines.

### Releases

On release, replace **Unreleased** with the proper release tag and date. Also, remove sections (Added, Fixed, Changed, Deprecated, etc) that are empty (have no items).
