# Patching or "Overriding" DKAN

## DKAN overrides

Sometimes you will need to make a patch directly to DKAN or a DKAN profile specific module.

These patches can go in **overrides.make**.

### Adding a Patch to Override DKAN

Any patches to DKAN or modules supplied by DKAN (any code in the dkan/ folder) should be added to the **config/overrides.make file** as a patch linked by a URL or a local patch contained in **config/assets/patches.**

Patches should be applied to the appropriate git repository, included in a pull request, and applied to your build as outlined below.

To test the application of the patch you can run **ahoy build overrides.**

Overrides are applied in the build process when running **ahoy build update VERSION**. See Updating Data Starter to Latest Version of DKAN

Here is a step by step process:

1. Create the patch
  1. Create a PR
  2. Make sure the PR can be merged into the **release-1-12**(or the release number you are working off of)
  3. Get a diff of the PR
    1. Go to https://github.com/NuCivic/MODULE/compare or https://github.com/NuCivic/dkan/compare
    2. Select the upstream branch, ie release-1-12, and the PR you want to override with. 
    Example: ![Confluence Pic](https://confluence.govdelivery.com/download/attachments/89326572/Screen%20Shot%202016-09-15%20at%2011.23.42%20AM.png?version=1&modificationDate=1473935044000&api=v2)
    3. Add **.diff** to the end
    4. Exmaple: https://github.com/NuCivic/dkan_datastore/compare/release-1-12...fix-filters-pw-1.diff
2. Add the patch to the **overrides.make**
  ```

  api: '2'
  core: 7.x
  projects:
    dkan_datastore:
      subdir: dkan
      download:
        type: git
        url: https://github.com/NuCivic/dkan_datastore.git
        tag: 7.x-1.12
      patch:
        1: "https://github.com/NuCivic/dkan_datastore/compare/release-1-12...fix-filters-pw-1.diff"
  ```

3. Test patch by running **ahoy build overrides**
  1. Patched module should appear in **docroot/sites/all/modules/overrides**
  
### Implementation Notes
During **ahoy site remake** there is a step to append whatever is at the end of the overrides.make file to dkan/drupal-org.make file.  In effect we are introducing overrides to the make file because anything that is defined last a make file overrides whatever has been defined first.

Such overrides are put in overrides folder within docroot/sites/all/modules/overrides.
