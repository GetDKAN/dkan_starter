NuData Starter is an Open Data platform based on the DKAN Open Data catalog created by NuCivic. NuData takes DKAN further by adding additional features.

NuData Starter provides:

* a best-practices example of building sites and services off of DKAN
* additional features not provided by DKAN

Free demos of NuData Starter can be requested by filling out the form at http://nucivic.com/products/nudata/demo/.

[NuData Enterprise](http://www.nucivic.com/products/nudata/enterprise/) is a software-as-a-service offering based off of NuData Starter.

Because we use NuData Starter to manage our software-as-a-service, it is frequently updated and we do not guarantee backwards compatibility.   Therefore, if you wish to build a custom open data website based on Drupal, we recommend that you start with the code from the DKAN Drupal Distribution repository instead.

We are open to contributions to this NuData repo, but in general we encourage developers interested in contributing to Drupalâ€™s open data management capabilities to contribute to the DKAN Distribution project and repository instead.
