================================================================================

Acquia Purge has been designed from the ground up to be extremely simple and
almost failsafe to use. The module provides the /means/ to purge all load
balancers on Acquia Cloud and focuses on doing that well, where the Expire
module remains responsible for telling what needs to be purged. Setting up both
modules shouldn't take long:

1. Ensure you are not running incompatible modules like purge, varnish or boost.

2. Download expire and acquia_purge into your site.
   e.g.: drush dl expire acquia_purge

3. Enable both modules.
   e.g.: drush en expire acquia_purge

4. Assign the "purge on-screen" permission to editor roles to give them a
   visually indicative progress bar upon saving content. Purges still happen
   without this permission on the background (triggered via AJAX).

5. It's highly recommended to visit the status report page or to run
   "drush ap-diagnosis", in which Acquia Purge will perform diagnostic tests.
