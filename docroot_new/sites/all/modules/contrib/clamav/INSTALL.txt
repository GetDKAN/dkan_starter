Requirements
------------

1. The module does not provide an anti-virus scanner; it integrates with
   ClamAV (http://www.clamav.net), which is a free open-source anti-virus
   scanner.
2. Download/install ClamAV:
  - [Debian / Ubuntu]: apt-get install clamav
  - [redhat / CentOS]:
    1. Enable the EPEL repo (https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL)
    2. yum install clamav
    3. yum install clamd

Installation
------------

1. Enable the module
2. Go to the ClamAV configuration page (admin/settings/clamav) and set
   the path to the ClamAV "clamscan" binary.  On most systems this will be:
   /usr/bin/clamscan

Configuration
-------------

By default only STREAM_WRAPPERS_LOCAL schemes are scannable, but this default
behaviour can be overridden; either in the admin UI, or with a variable.

For example, putting this in settings.php

$conf['clamav_overridden_schemes'] = array(
  'public',
  'external',
);

...would override the default for the public:// and external:// schemes.

Overriding a local scheme will stop it from being scannable, and a remote
scheme will become scannable if it is overridden.
