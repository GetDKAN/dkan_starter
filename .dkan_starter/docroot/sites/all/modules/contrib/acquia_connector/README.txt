Acquia Connector modules
================================================================================

An Acquia subscription [1] enhances the Drupal experience by providing the
support and network services to operate a trouble-free Drupal website.
Acquia subscriptions let you gain access to remote network services,
documentation and the Acquia forums. Premium subscriptions provide web-based
support ticket management, as well as telephone support.

These modules allow you to connect any Drupal 7.x site to Acquia Insight.
Acquia also has a distribution of Drupal called Acquia Drupal which is
composed of purely open source GPL licensed components. If you are looking
for a quick start with Drupal, Acquia Drupal [2] might be of great use for you.
(Note that a few Acquia Subscription services, such as the update notification and
code modification detection services, currently only work with Acquia Drupal.)
