# Configure Secure Pages
Secure pages is useful as in interim solution until we get "HTTPs Everywhere" support.

To setup secure pages properly:

1. Ensure securepages module is enabled in custom_config
2. Change 'https_securepages' to TRUE in config.yml

This will trigger the secure_pages settings in settings.acquia.php
