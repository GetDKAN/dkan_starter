# Setting up a project locally

1. Install docker as described in [Local Docker Environment](https://confluence.govdelivery.com/display/NCKB/Local+Docker+Environment)
2. Run **docker-machine start default; eval "$(docker-machine env default)"** if you haven't already
3. cd into "~/docker-share/CLIENT-GIT-REPO" 
4. Setup S3 backup access
  1. Ask Pluto for S3 credentials
  2. create aws credentials file
    1. vim ~/.s3-curl
    2. Add
    ```
    %awsSecretAccessKeys = (
      local => {
        id => 'AWS_ID',
        key => 'AWS_KEY',
      }
    );
    ```
5. run **ahoy docker up** will bring up docker containers
6. run **ahoy site setup to setup** settings.php files
7. run **ahoy custom setup** (if there are customizations)
8. run **ahoy ci setup** to load databases and bring up site
9. run **ahoy ci deploy** to do the environment switching and run deployment hook.
10. run **ahoy docker url** to get the site url

## Troubleshooting

### s3curl

The asset download command which is called from `ahoy ci setup` uses an AWS perl script.  This script usually will work without issues, however sometimes you may need to download a missing Perl module.  For example:

If you run into the following error:
```
ahoy site asset-download-db
Can't locate Digest/HMAC_SHA1.pm in @INC (you may need to install the Digest::HMAC_SHA1 module) (@INC contains: /usr/local/Cellar/perl/5.24.0_1/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.24.0/darwin-thread-multi-2level /usr/local/Cellar/perl/5.24.0_1/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.24.0 /usr/local/Cellar/perl/5.24.0_1/lib/perl5/5.24.0/darwin-thread-multi-2level /usr/local/Cellar/perl/5.24.0_1/lib/perl5/5.24.0 /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.24.0 .) at nucivic-ahoy/.scripts/s3curl.pl line 20.
BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at nucivic-ahoy/.scripts/s3curl.pl line 20.
```

then, do this: 

```
perl -MCPAN -e "install Digest::HMAC_SHA1;"
```
of course the specific module will depend on your error.

### Hostname/alias errors

The ahoy custom setup command will fail if you do not have the Acquia aliases set up correctly on your local environment. Make sure you are logged into Acquia (drush ac-api-login) then update your Acquia aliases (drush acquia-update).
